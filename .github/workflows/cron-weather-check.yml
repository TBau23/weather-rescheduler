# GitHub Actions Cron Job for Weather Rescheduler
#
# This workflow is an alternative to Vercel's built-in cron jobs (which require Pro plan).
# It triggers the /api/cron/weather-check endpoint hourly.
#
# Setup:
# 1. Go to your GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
# 2. Add these secrets:
#    - APP_URL: Your Vercel deployment URL (e.g., https://your-app.vercel.app)
#    - CRON_SECRET: The same secret you set in Vercel environment variables
# 3. Push this file to your repo
# 4. GitHub Actions will run it hourly automatically
